					Before metrics-server, Kubernetes collected monitoring information
					into a program called Heapster. Heapster was built on top of InfluxDB
					1.
				</div>
			</div>

			<p class="mb-4 font-medium">
				After moving on from InfluxData, David joined Equinix Metal where he
				continued to work-on and grow the Rawkode Academy by helping developers
				and operators learn how to run and use Kubernetes, and other Cloud
				Native technologies, on bare metal; which comes with a whole host of
				challenges that are not present when running on a cloud provider.
			</p>

			<p class="mb-4 font-medium">
				Throughout his time working with Kubernetes, David was a fan and keen
				watcher of TGIK, a weekly live stream hosted by Joe Beda, one of the
				creators of Kubernetes. On TGIK, Joe live streamed himself exploring new
				Cloud Native technologies, by working through the documentation and
				examples. Often, he'd rely on the maintainers and contributors to those
				projects being active in the chat to help him out when he got stuck.
				This is when David decided that he wanted to carry on TGIK in his own
				way, by inviting the maintainers and contributors of said projects on a
				live-stream with him, where they could not only help him when there were
				issues, but also talk about the project and the problems it solves while
				sharing its history, flavour, and context.

					Before the live-stream was called "Rawkode Live", the name "RTFM" was
