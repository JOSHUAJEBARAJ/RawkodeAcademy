## The CommitOps Podcast

### What is CommitOps?

CommitOps is a monthly CICD and GitOps podcast that features four amazing guests, every month, from the best CICD companies in the Cloud Native community.

We meet on first Wednesday of every month with our panel to discuss a topic within the Cloud Native security space.

The podcast will be recorded live and streamed to YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The podcast will also be published to all major podcast platforms.
