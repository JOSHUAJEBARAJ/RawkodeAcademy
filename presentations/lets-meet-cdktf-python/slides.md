# ClickOps

What is ClickOps?

ClickOps is the process of managing and provisioning Things\<T\> through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

- AWS Console
- Cloudflare Dashboard
- Beekeeper Studio

---

# ClickOps

Challenges

- Not repeatable
- **Humans are fallible**
- History / flavour / context is lost

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

What is IaC?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning Things\<T\> through code, or code like, definitions.

Typically commands consume these definitions and perform a "reconciliation" to ensure the state of the Things\<T\> matches the definitions.

When the real world doesn't reflect the definition, this is called "Drift"

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Advantages

- Repeatable
- Machines are less fallible
- Current state and history stored in version control
- Knowledge sharing through pull requests

# üêò in the üßπ

Before I continue ...

I used to work for Pulumi ... why am I talking about Terraform CDK?

<hr/>

1. Terraform is ubiquitous, mature, and well adopted
2. Using code as an intermediatory is actually a good thing
   1. Easier to stick to declarative
3. Pulumi relies on Terraform providers (atm)
   1. You can actually use CDK Constructs within Pulumi

# Language Support

Powered by JSII

- Python
- TypeScript / JavaScript
- Go
- Java
- More in the future?
  - Hoping for Rust

---

# TypeScript by Default

You can actually convert, with JSII, TypeScript constructs to any supported language.

So there's a lot of value in writing shared components this way, unless you're an exclusively Python shop.

# AWS Vs. Terraform CDK

## AWS CDK

- AWS only
- Renders CloudFormation
- CloudFormation for Execution

---

# AWS Vs. Terraform CDK

## Terraform CDK

- Use any Terraform provider
- Renders Terraform JSON
- Terraform for Execution

---

# Demo

### ‚å®Ô∏è Wish me luck!

# Thoughts

Hopefully I showed: get, synth, plan, deploy, destroy

- Terraform CDK is a fantastic interface to Terraform
- You can still use Terraform CLI
- JIT providers is a nice touch over precompiled
- Testing isn't great
  - But really, there's better tools:
    - CUE
    - Rego
- L1/L2/L3 constructs & the Construct Hub have potential to be powerful
- Interopt with cdk8s ü§Ø

# Thanks

Until next time
