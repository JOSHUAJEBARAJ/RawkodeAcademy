# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

What is IaC?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning Things\<T\> through code, or code like, definitions.

Typically commands consume these definitions and perform a "reconciliation" to ensure the state of the Things\<T\> matches the definitions.

When the real world doesn't reflect the definition, this is called "Drift"

# üêò in the üßπ

Before I Continue ...

I used to work for Pulumi ... why am I talking about Terraform CDK?

<hr/>

1. Terraform is ubiquitous, mature, and well adopted
2. Using code as an intermediatory is actually a good thing
   1. Easier to stick to declarative
3. I'm not here to sell you anything
