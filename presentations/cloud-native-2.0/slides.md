# What is Cloud Native?

The CNCF used to define Cloud Native as:

# What is Cloud Native?

This changed.

It was redefined, in the open, by members of the early Cloud Native community.

> Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

> These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

> The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral projects. We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these innovations accessible for everyone.

# What is Cloud Native?

Why this changed?

## The CNCF scope was changing

It adopted it's first 15 projects within the first 2 years.

It wasn't merely a home for Kubernetes and Prometheus, but for OpenTracing, Fluentd, Linkerd, gRPC, CoreDNS, containerd, rkt, CNI, Envoy, Notary, TUF, with Rook being project 15 (2018).

Why this changed?

## New Patterns

- Serverless Adoption Goes üöÄ
- Docker purchases Unikernel Systems (2016)
- Event-Driven / Workflow based (Cadence) gains momentum (2017)
- WebAssembly was born (2017)

Containers are great, except when they're not

- OS Portability
- Architecture / Multi Platform / Manifests
- macOS File Sharing for Interpreted Languages
- Cold Start Times
- Virtualization / Distribution / Size (GBs!?)
- Process Limits / Resource Utilization / Pause Containers
- "Sandbox"

# Docker Isn't Ignoring This

- Docker Desktop can run WASM with 4 major runtimes:
  - slight
  - spin
  - wasmedge
  - wasmtime

- Distribution / Registry Support

- docker compose

# Let's Spin

I can't show you all the WASM runtimes

Spin, from Fermyon, is leading the charge with:

- DX focused
- Feature complete (KV, Triggers, Cloud Hosting)
- SDK support (Rust, NodeJS, Python, Go, dotNet)

# Demo

Wish me luck!

## Remind me to:

- Build a Spin app
- Push to GHCR
- Deploy KWasm
- Deploy to Kubernetes
- Multi Component ü§Ø
